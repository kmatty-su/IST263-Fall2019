Main idea for website: My foundation of my website is going to be about veganism. I myself am a vegan, and I get a lot of questions about how I became vegan, what motivated me to become vegan, how did I transition from having a carnivorous diet to a vegan diet, what benefits have I personally seen in my body after becoming vegan etc. I want to explain all of those questions on this website, and also educate people on the benefits of being vegan and also how it positively affects our health, planet, and animals.
